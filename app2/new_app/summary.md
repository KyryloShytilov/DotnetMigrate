# .NET 8 Migration - HomeController Update Summary

## Changes Made

1. Updated the HomeController to follow .NET 8 and ASP.NET Core MVC conventions:
   - Changed return type from `ActionResult` to `IActionResult`
   - Implemented dependency injection with ILogger for proper logging
   - Removed unnecessary legacy namespaces
   - Added error handling with Error action method
   - Used file-scoped namespace with semicolon syntax
   - Added [AllowAnonymous] attribute to make security intent explicit

## Benefits

1. **Improved Error Handling**: Added standard error handling approach with Error action method and ErrorViewModel
2. **Better Logging**: Integrated with .NET Core's logging infrastructure
3. **Modern C# Syntax**: Used latest language features like file-scoped namespaces
4. **Clear Authorization**: Explicitly declares the controller's authorization requirements
5. **Clean Architecture**: Follows .NET 8 best practices for controller organization

The controller is now fully compatible with .NET 8 and follows all recommended best practices.
